Ninjaboard To Kunena Convert

First off I would like to say, that I love ninjaboard and the Nooku Framework guys. They are really pushing the limit with some really great code
The project that I was working on needed this convertor So I whipped it up real quick. It is nothing pretty, but it did work for a forum with  thousands of posts, replies and threads. 

I would be happy to help you improve on this, or you can steal it and use the queries to put it in a component based  convertor.

Cheers
